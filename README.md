### Date created
Wrangle and Analyze Data project was created on 21-Oct-2021.

### Project Title
Wrangle and Analyze Data

### Description
In this project, I wrangled (i.e. gathered, assessed and cleaned) twitter archive
data from [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). I analyzed the cleaned data and produced 3 insights from the data
with some visualization.

### Files used
The following three files are used in this project:

twitter-archive-enhanced.csv - basic tweet data with ratings and dog stage.

image-predictions.tsv - Every image in the tweet archive file is run through a
neural network that can identify breeds of dogs and the top 3 predictions identified
by the algorithm are included in this file along with tweet id.

tweet-json.txt - addition tweet data including retweet count and favorite count
obtained via Twitter API.

### Files and reports produced
wrangle_act.ipynb - jupyter notebook showing the steps involved in data wrangling
and analysis.

twitter_archive_master.csv - cleaned data.

wrangle_report.html - report that briefly describes my wrangling efforts.

act_report.html - data analysis and visualization report with 3 insights.
